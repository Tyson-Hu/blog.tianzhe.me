<h1 id="Module-1-Intro-to-Amazon-Web-Services"><a href="#Module-1-Intro-to-Amazon-Web-Services" class="headerlink" title="Module 1: Intro to Amazon Web Services"></a>Module 1: Intro to Amazon Web Services</h1><h2 id="Benefits-of-cloud-computing"><a href="#Benefits-of-cloud-computing" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of cloud computing"></a>Benefits of cloud computing</h2><h3 id="Trade-upfront-expense-for-variable-expense"><a href="#Trade-upfront-expense-for-variable-expense" class="headerlink" title="Trade upfront expense for variable expense"></a>Trade upfront expense for variable expense</h3><p>Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-spending-money-to-run-and-maintain-data-centers"><a href="#Stop-spending-money-to-run-and-maintain-data-centers" class="headerlink" title="Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers"></a>Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers</h3><p>Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers. </p>
<p>A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-guessing-capacity"><a href="#Stop-guessing-capacity" class="headerlink" title="Stop guessing capacity"></a>Stop guessing capacity</h3><p>With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application. </p>
<p>For example, you can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time you use. Instead of paying for unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.</p>
<h3 id="Benefit-from-massive-economies-of-scale"><a href="#Benefit-from-massive-economies-of-scale" class="headerlink" title="Benefit from massive economies of scale"></a>Benefit from massive economies of scale</h3><p>By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.</p>
<p>Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale. The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices. </p>
<h3 id="Increase-speed-and-agility"><a href="#Increase-speed-and-agility" class="headerlink" title="Increase speed and agility"></a>Increase speed and agility</h3><p>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.</p>
<p>This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison, cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.</p>
<h3 id="Go-global-in-minutes"><a href="#Go-global-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Go global in minutes"></a>Go global in minutes</h3><p>The global footprint of the AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency. This means that even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays. </p>
<h2 id="Models-for-Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Models-for-Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Models for Cloud Computing"></a>Models for Cloud Computing</h2><h3 id="Infrastructure-as-a-Service-IaaS"><a href="#Infrastructure-as-a-Service-IaaS" class="headerlink" title="Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"></a>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3><p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today</p>
<h3 id="Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS"><a href="#Platform-as-a-Service-PaaS" class="headerlink" title="Platform as a Service (PaaS)"></a>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.</p>
<h3 id="Software-as-a-Service-SaaS"><a href="#Software-as-a-Service-SaaS" class="headerlink" title="Software as a Service (SaaS)"></a>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.</p>
<h2 id="Deployment-models-for-cloud-computing"><a href="#Deployment-models-for-cloud-computing" class="headerlink" title="Deployment models for cloud computing"></a>Deployment models for cloud computing</h2><h3 id="Cloud-based-Deployment"><a href="#Cloud-based-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="Cloud-based Deployment"></a>Cloud-based Deployment</h3><ul>
<li>Run all parts of the application in the cloud.</li>
<li>Migrate existing applications to the cloud.</li>
<li>Design and build new applications in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <strong>cloud-based deployment</strong> model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="On-premises-Deployment"><a href="#On-premises-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="On-premises Deployment"></a>On-premises Deployment</h3><ul>
<li>Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.</li>
<li>Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On-premises deployment</strong> is also known as a <em>private cloud</em> deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.</p>
<h3 id="Hybrid-Deployment"><a href="#Hybrid-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="Hybrid Deployment"></a>Hybrid Deployment</h3><ul>
<li>Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.</li>
<li>Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <strong>hybrid deployment</strong>, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.</p>
<h3 id="Cloud-vs-On-premises"><a href="#Cloud-vs-On-premises" class="headerlink" title="Cloud vs On-premises"></a>Cloud vs On-premises</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Location of Resources</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>On-premises</strong>: The resources (compute, storage, networking) are physically located at the user’s own facilities. This provides greater control over the physical infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Deployment</strong>: Resources are hosted on AWS’s infrastructure across their global network of data centers. Users don’t manage the physical hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control and Maintenance</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>On-premises</strong>: Organizations have full control over their hardware and are responsible for its maintenance and upgrades. This can be advantageous for meeting specific regulatory or compliance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Deployment</strong>: AWS manages the infrastructure, including security, maintenance, and hardware upgrades. Users are relieved from the operational overhead of managing physical servers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>On-premises</strong>: Scaling often requires physical installation of new hardware, which can be slower and less flexible.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Deployment</strong>: Offers virtually limitless scalability on-demand without the need to invest in physical hardware upfront.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>On-premises</strong>: Involves upfront capital expenditure (CapEx) for hardware and ongoing costs for maintenance and operation.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Deployment</strong>: Generally operates on a pay-as-you-go model where you pay for compute power, storage, and other resources as you use them, shifting to operational expenditure (OpEx).</li>
</ul>

No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.</p>
<p>Sample use cases for On-Demand Instances include developing and testing applications and running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns. On-Demand Instances are not recommended for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience greater cost savings using Reserved Instances.</p>
<h3 id="Reserved-Instances"><a href="#Reserved-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Reserved Instances"></a>Reserved Instances</h3><p><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. There are two available types of Reserved Instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Reserved Instances</li>
<li>Convertible Reserved Instances</li>
</ul>
<p>You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option. </p>
<h4 id="Standard-Reserved-Instances"><a href="#Standard-Reserved-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Standard Reserved Instances"></a>Standard Reserved Instances</h4><p>This option is a good fit if you know the EC2 instance type and size you need for your steady-state applications and in which AWS Region you plan to run them. Reserved Instances require you to state the following qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instance type and size:</strong> For example, <code>m5.xlarge</code></li>
<li><strong>Platform description (operating system):</strong> For example, Microsoft Windows Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>
<li><strong>Tenancy:</strong> Default tenancy or dedicated tenancy</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to specify an Availability Zone for your EC2 Reserved Instances. If you make this specification, you get EC2 capacity reservation. This ensures that your desired amount of EC2 instances will be available when you need them. </p>
<h4 id="Convertible-Reserved-Instances"><a href="#Convertible-Reserved-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Convertible Reserved Instances"></a>Convertible Reserved Instances</h4><p>If you need to run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types, then Convertible Reserved Instances might be right for you. Note: You trade in a deeper discount when you require flexibility to run your EC2 instances.</p>
<p>At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. However, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminate the instance.</li>
<li>Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance family and size, Region, platform, and tenancy).</li>

<td><strong>Flexibility in Modification</strong></td>
<td>These are less flexible in terms of modification. Once purchased, you can only modify attributes like the Availability Zone, network platform, and instance size (within the same instance type family) provided that the total capacity reserved remains the same. <br/><br/>You cannot change the instance family or operating system.</td>
<td>These offer much greater flexibility. Convertible RIs allow you to change the instance family, operating system, tenancy, or payment option at any time during the RI term, as long as the exchange results in creating Reserved Instances of equal or greater value. This is particularly beneficial if you anticipate future changes in your requirements or advances in technology.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Cost and Discount Level</strong></td>
<td>They typically offer a higher discount level compared to Convertible Reserved Instances, up to 72% off the on-demand price. <br/> <br/>The discount reflects the lack of flexibility in modifying the RI attributes beyond the basic changes mentioned.</td>
<td>These provide a lower discount, up to 66% off the on-demand price, as a trade-off for the increased flexibility. <br/><br/>The lower discount rate compensates for the ability to change to newer or different instance types as needs evolve.</td>

<h3 id="EC2-Instance-Saving-Plans"><a href="#EC2-Instance-Saving-Plans" class="headerlink" title="EC2 Instance Saving Plans"></a>EC2 Instance Saving Plans</h3><p><strong>EC2 Instance Savings Plans</strong> reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make <strong>an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and Region for a 1-year or 3-year term</strong>. This term commitment results in savings of up to 72 percent compared to On-Demand rates. <strong>Any usage up to the commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plans rate (for example, $10 per hour)</strong>. Any usage beyond the commitment is charged at regular On-Demand rates.</p>
<p>The EC2 Instance Savings Plans are a good option if you need flexibility in your Amazon EC2 usage over the duration of the commitment term. You have the benefit of saving costs on running any EC2 instance within an EC2 instance family in a chosen Region (for example, M5 usage in N. Virginia) regardless of Availability Zone, instance size, OS, or tenancy. The savings with EC2 Instance Savings Plans are similar to the savings provided by Standard Reserved Instances.</p>
<p>Unlike Reserved Instances, however, you don’t need to specify up front what EC2 instance type and size (for example, m5.xlarge), OS, and tenancy to get a discount. Further, you don’t need to commit to a certain number of EC2 instances over a 1-year or 3-year term. Additionally, the EC2 Instance Savings Plans don’t include an EC2 capacity reservation option.</p>
<h3 id="Spot-Instances"><a href="#Spot-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Spot Instances"></a>Spot Instances</h3><p><strong>Spot Instances</strong> are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a background processing job that can start and stop as needed (such as the data processing job for a customer survey). You want to start and stop the processing job without affecting the overall operations of your business. <strong>If you make a Spot request and Amazon EC2 capacity is available, your Spot Instance launches. However, if you make a Spot request and Amazon EC2 capacity is unavailable, the request is not successful until capacity becomes available. The unavailable capacity might delay the launch of your background processing job.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After you have launched a Spot Instance, if capacity is no longer available or demand for Spot Instances increases, your instance may be interrupted.</strong> This might not pose any issues for your background processing job. However, in the earlier example of developing and testing applications, you would most likely want to avoid unexpected interruptions. Therefore, choose a different EC2 instance type that is ideal for those tasks.</p>
<h3 id="Dedicated-Hosts"><a href="#Dedicated-Hosts" class="headerlink" title="Dedicated Hosts"></a>Dedicated Hosts</h3><p><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. </p>
<p>You can use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance. You can purchase On-Demand Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Hosts Reservations. Of all the Amazon EC2 options that were covered, Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.</p>
<h2 id="Scaling-Amazon-EC2"><a href="#Scaling-Amazon-EC2" class="headerlink" title="Scaling Amazon EC2"></a>Scaling Amazon EC2</h2><h3 id="Scalability"><a href="#Scalability" class="headerlink" title="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h3><p><strong>Scalability</strong> involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in. <strong>As a result, you pay for only the resources you use.</strong> You don’t have to worry about a lack of computing capacity to meet your customers’ needs.</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-EC2-Auto-Scaling"><a href="#Amazon-EC2-Auto-Scaling" class="headerlink" title="Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling"></a>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</h3><p>If you wanted the scaling process to happen automatically, the AWS service that provides this functionality for Amazon EC2 instances is <strong>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</strong>.</p>
<p>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand. By automatically scaling your instances in and out as needed, you can maintain a greater sense of application availability.</p>
<p>Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dynamic scaling</em> responds to changing demand. </li>
<li><em>Predictive scaling</em> automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To scale faster, you can use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling together.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Example-Amazon-EC2-Auto-Scaling"><a href="#Example-Amazon-EC2-Auto-Scaling" class="headerlink" title="Example: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling"></a>Example: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</h3><p>Suppose that you are preparing to launch an application on Amazon EC2 instances. When configuring the size of your Auto Scaling group, you might set the minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances at one. This means that at all times, there must be at least one Amazon EC2 instance running.</p>
<p>When you create an Auto Scaling group, you can set the minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances. The <strong>minimum capacity</strong> is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group. In this example, the Auto Scaling group has a minimum capacity of one Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419140415019.png" alt="Auto Scaling Group"></p>
<p>Next, you can set the <strong>desired capacity</strong> at two Amazon EC2 instances even though your application needs a minimum of a single Amazon EC2 instance to run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not specify the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third configuration that you can set in an Auto Scaling group is the <strong>maximum capacity</strong>. For example, you might configure the Auto Scaling group to scale out in response to increased demand, but only to a maximum of four Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
<p>Because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses Amazon EC2 instances, you pay for only the instances you use, when you use them. You now have a cost-effective architecture that provides the best customer experience while reducing expenses.</p>
<h2 id="Directing-Traffic-with-Elastic-Load-Balancing"><a href="#Directing-Traffic-with-Elastic-Load-Balancing" class="headerlink" title="Directing Traffic with Elastic Load Balancing"></a>Directing Traffic with Elastic Load Balancing</h2><h3 id="Elastic-Load-Balancing"><a href="#Elastic-Load-Balancing" class="headerlink" title="Elastic Load Balancing"></a>Elastic Load Balancing</h3><p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing</strong> is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. </p>
<p>A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group. This means that as you add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to the amount of incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first.Then, the requests spread across multiple resources that will handle them. For example, if you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing distributes the workload across the multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elastic Load Balance is one of the shelf load balancers, you can use want ever you want in AWS. </p>
<p>After adding ELB, it become the middle man between frontend and backend, which means frontend does not need to care about the backend server, it just send all data to ELB, then ELB handles this data and sends to the backend server and make sure they works balance.</p>

<p>Although Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling are separate services, they work together to help ensure that applications running in Amazon EC2 can provide high performance and availability. </p>
<h3 id="Example-Elastic-Load-Balancing"><a href="#Example-Elastic-Load-Balancing" class="headerlink" title="Example: Elastic Load Balancing"></a>Example: Elastic Load Balancing</h3><h4 id="Low-demand-period"><a href="#Low-demand-period" class="headerlink" title="Low-demand period"></a>Low-demand period</h4><p>Here’s an example of how Elastic Load Balancing works.

<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419160429990.png" alt="ELB Low-demand period"></p>
<p>If only a few registers are open, this matches the demand of customers who need service. The coffee shop is less likely to have open registers with no customers. In this example, you can think of the registers as Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
<h4 id="High-demand-period"><a href="#High-demand-period" class="headerlink" title="High-demand period"></a>High-demand period</h4><p>Throughout the day, as the number of customers increases, the coffee shop opens more registers to accommodate them. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419160532449.png" alt="ELB High-demand period"></p>
<p>Additionally, a coffee shop employee directs customers to the most appropriate register so that the number of requests can evenly distribute across the open registers. You can think of this coffee shop employee as a load balancer. </p>

The components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running. </p>
<p>Suppose that you have an application with <strong>tightly coupled</strong> components. These components might include databases, servers, the user interface, business logic, and so on. This type of architecture can be considered a <strong>monolithic application</strong>. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419161415352.png" alt="Monolithic application"></p>
<p>In this approach to application architecture, <strong>if a single component fails, other components fail, and possibly the entire application fails</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can design your application through a <strong>microservices</strong> approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a microservices approach, application components are <strong>loosely coupled</strong>. In this case, <strong>if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other.</strong> The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. </p>
<p>When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions. Two services facilitate application integration: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service-Amazon-SNS"><a href="#Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service-Amazon-SNS" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)"></a>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</h3><p><strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</strong> is a publish&#x2F;subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.</p>
<p>In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options. </p>
<h4 id="Scenario-1-Publishing-updates-from-a-single-topic"><a href="#Scenario-1-Publishing-updates-from-a-single-topic" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: Publishing updates from a single topic"></a>Scenario 1: Publishing updates from a single topic</h4><p>Suppose that the coffee shop has a single newsletter that includes updates from all areas of its business. It includes topics such as coupons, coffee trivia, and new products. All of these topics are grouped because this is a single newsletter. All customers who subscribe to the newsletter receive updates about coupons, coffee trivia, and new products.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419162122060.png" alt="Single Topics"></p>
<p>After a while, some customers express that they would prefer to receive separate newsletters for only the specific topics that interest them. The coffee shop owners decide to try this approach.</p>
<h4 id="Scenario-2-Publishing-updates-from-multiple-topics"><a href="#Scenario-2-Publishing-updates-from-multiple-topics" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: Publishing updates from multiple topics"></a>Scenario 2: Publishing updates from multiple topics</h4><p>Now, instead of having a single newsletter for all topics, the coffee shop has broken it up into three separate newsletters.

<p>Subscribers will now receive updates immediately for only the specific topics to which they have subscribed.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419162306462.png" alt="Multiple Topics"></p>
<p>It is possible for subscribers to subscribe to a single topic or to multiple topics.

Think of the cashier and the barista as two separate components of an application. </p>
<p>First, the cashier takes an order and writes it down on a piece of paper. Next, the cashier delivers the paper to the barista. Finally, the barista makes the drink and gives it to the customer.</p>
<p>When the next order comes in, the process repeats. This process runs smoothly as long as both the cashier and the barista are coordinated.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419162859934.png" alt="Fulfilling an order in coffee shop"></p>
<p>What might happen if the cashier took an order and went to deliver it to the barista, but the barista was out on a break or busy with another order? The cashier would need to wait until the barista is ready to accept the order. This would cause delays in the ordering process and require customers to wait longer to receive their orders.</p>
<p>As the coffee shop has become more popular and the ordering line is moving more slowly, the owners notice that the current ordering process is time consuming and inefficient. They decide to try a different approach that uses a queue.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419163026262.png" alt="Orders in a queue"></p>
<p>Recall that the cashier and the barista are two separate components of an application. A message queuing service, such as Amazon SQS, lets messages between decoupled application complements.</p>
<p>In this example, the first step in the process remains the same as before: a customer places an order with the cashier. </p>
<p>The cashier puts the order into a queue. You can think of this as an order board that serves as a buffer between the cashier and the barista. Even if the barista is out on a break or busy with another order, the cashier can continue placing new orders into the queue. </p>
<p>Next, the barista checks the queue and retrieves the order.</p>
<p>The barista prepares the drink and gives it to the customer. </p>
<p>The barista then removes the completed order from the queue. </p>
<p>While the barista is preparing the drink, the cashier is able to continue taking new orders and add them to the queue.</p>
<p>**This decoupled approach enables the separate components to work more efficiently and independently. **</p>

<ol>
<li>Provision instances (virtual servers).</li>
<li>Upload your code.</li>
<li>Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers.</strong> With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419164332166.png" alt="Serverless comparison"></p>
<p>Another benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically. Serverless computing can adjust the applications’ capacity by modifying the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory. </p>
<p>An AWS service for serverless computing is <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-Lambda"><a href="#AWS-Lambda" class="headerlink" title="AWS Lambda"></a>AWS Lambda</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda"><strong>AWS Lambda</strong></a> is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. </p>
<p>While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. </p>
<p>For example, a simple Lambda function might involve automatically resizing uploaded images to the AWS Cloud. In this case, the function triggers when uploading a new image. </p>
<h4 id="How-AWS-Lambda-works"><a href="#How-AWS-Lambda-works" class="headerlink" title="How AWS Lambda works"></a>How AWS Lambda works</h4><ol>

<h3 id="Containers"><a href="#Containers" class="headerlink" title="Containers"></a>Containers</h3><p>In AWS, you can also build and run <strong>containerized</strong> applications. <strong>Containers</strong> provide you with a standard way to package your application’s code and dependencies into a single object. You can also use containers for processes and workflows in which there are essential requirements for security, reliability, and scalability.</p>
<p>Suppose that a company’s application developer has an environment on their computer that is different from the environment on the computers used by the IT operations staff. The developer wants to ensure that the application’s environment remains consistent regardless of deployment, so they use a containerized approach. This helps to reduce time spent debugging applications and diagnosing differences in computing environments.</p>

<p>When running containerized applications, it’s important to consider scalability. Suppose that instead of a single host with multiple containers, you have to manage tens of hosts with hundreds of containers. Alternatively, <strong>you have to manage possibly hundreds of hosts with thousands of containers.</strong> At a large scale, imagine how much time it might take for you to monitor memory usage, security, logging, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="Selecting-a-Region"><a href="#Selecting-a-Region" class="headerlink" title="Selecting a Region"></a>Selecting a Region</h3><p>When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Compliance (Data Governance &amp; Legal Requirements)</strong></td>
<td>Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas. For example, if your company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, you would choose the London Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Proximity (to your customers)</strong></td>
<td>Selecting a Region that is close to your customers will help you to get content to them faster. For example, your company is based in Washington, DC, and many of your customers live in Singapore. You might consider running your infrastructure in the Northern Virginia Region to be close to company headquarters, and run your applications from the Singapore Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Available services (within a Region)</strong></td>
<td>Sometimes, the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers. AWS is frequently innovating by creating new services and expanding on features within existing services. However, making new services available around the world sometimes requires AWS to build out physical hardware one Region at a time. <br/><br/>Suppose that your developers want to build an application that uses Amazon Braket (AWS quantum computing platform). As of this course, Amazon Braket is not yet available in every AWS Region around the world, so your developers would have to run it in one of the Regions that already offers it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pricing</strong></td>
<td>Suppose that you are considering running applications in both the United States and Brazil. The way Brazil’s tax structure is set up, it might cost 50% more to run the same workload out of the São Paulo Region compared to the Oregon Region. You will learn in more detail that several factors determine pricing, but for now know that the cost of services can vary from Region to Region.</td>

<h3 id="Availability-Zones"><a href="#Availability-Zones" class="headerlink" title="Availability Zones"></a>Availability Zones</h3><p>An <strong>Availability Zone</strong> is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to have low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419184423148.png" alt="Availability Zones"></p>
<p>Suppose that you’re running an application on a single Amazon EC2 instance in the Northern California Region. The instance is running in the us-west-1a Availability Zone. If us-west-1a were to fail, you would lose your instance. </p>

<p>Instead of requiring your customers to get their data from Brazil, you can cache a copy locally at an edge location that is close to your customers in China. </p>
<p>When a customer in China requests one of your files, Amazon CloudFront retrieves the file from the cache in the edge location and delivers the file to the customer. The file is delivered to the customer faster because it came from the edge location near China instead of the original source in Brazil.</p>

You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419191123779.png" alt="AWS Management Console"></p>

<li>Application health monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="AWS-CloudFormation"><a href="#AWS-CloudFormation" class="headerlink" title="AWS CloudFormation"></a>AWS CloudFormation</h4><p>With <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong>, you can treat your infrastructure as code. This means that you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.</p>
<p>AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions. It determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors.</p>
<h4 id="Key-Differences"><a href="#Key-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Key Differences"></a>Key Differences</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Level of Control</strong>: CloudFormation provides more granular control over AWS resources, allowing you to script exactly how they should be provisioned and managed. Elastic Beanstalk abstracts much of this detail away, managing it internally based on the provided application code and settings.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Elastic Beanstalk is more application-centric, focusing on simplifying application deployments. CloudFormation is more infrastructure-centric, focusing on providing full control and management of AWS resources.</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Elastic Beanstalk is targeted at developers who want to quickly deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. CloudFormation is aimed at developers and system administrators who need to manage resources and infrastructure in a repeatable, predictable manner across diverse environments.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Flexibility</strong>: CloudFormation offers the flexibility to manage complex architectures by defining detailed templates. Elastic Beanstalk is easier to use but offers less flexibility for customization compared to CloudFormation.</li>

Also, imagine the millions of resources that these customers have created, such as Amazon EC2 instances. Without boundaries around all of these resources, network traffic would be able to flow between them unrestricted. </p>
<p>A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/"><strong>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. Within a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets. A <strong>subnet</strong> is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
<h3 id="Internet-gateway"><a href="#Internet-gateway" class="headerlink" title="Internet gateway"></a>Internet gateway</h3><p>To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an <strong>internet gateway</strong> to the VPC.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419210143081.png" alt="IGW"></p>
<p>An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you have a VPC that includes only private resources?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Virtual-private-gateway"><a href="#Virtual-private-gateway" class="headerlink" title="Virtual private gateway"></a>Virtual private gateway</h3><p>To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a <strong>virtual private gateway</strong>. </p>
<p>Here’s an example of how a virtual private gateway works. You can think of the internet as the road between your home and the coffee shop. Suppose that you are traveling on this road with a bodyguard to protect you. You are still using the same road as other customers, but with an extra layer of protection. </p>
<p>The bodyguard is like a virtual private network (VPN) connection that encrypts (or protects) your internet traffic from all the other requests around it. </p>
<p>The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. Even though your connection to the coffee shop has extra protection, traffic jams are possible because you’re using the same road as other customers. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419210251150.png" alt="Virtual private gateway"></p>
<p>A virtual private gateway enables you to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network, such as an on-premises data center or internal corporate network. A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-Direct-Connect"><a href="#AWS-Direct-Connect" class="headerlink" title="AWS Direct Connect"></a>AWS Direct Connect</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/"><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong></a> is a service that lets you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.  </p>
<p>Suppose that there is an apartment building with a hallway directly linking the building to the coffee shop. Only the residents of the apartment building can travel through this hallway. </p>
<p>This private hallway provides the same type of dedicated connection as AWS Direct Connect. Residents are able to get into the coffee shop without needing to use the public road shared with other customers. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419210417200.png" alt="AWS Direct Connect"></p>
<p>The private connection that AWS Direct Connect provides helps you to reduce network costs and increase the amount of bandwidth that can travel through your network.</p>
<h2 id="Subnets-and-Network-Access-Control-Lists"><a href="#Subnets-and-Network-Access-Control-Lists" class="headerlink" title="Subnets and Network Access Control Lists"></a>Subnets and Network Access Control Lists</h2><h3 id="Subnets"><a href="#Subnets" class="headerlink" title="Subnets"></a>Subnets</h3><p>A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private. </p>
<p><strong>Public subnets</strong> contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.</p>
<p><strong>Private subnets</strong> contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal information and order histories. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419211926132.png" alt="Subnets"></p>
<p>In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.</p>
<h4 id="Example-Subnet"><a href="#Example-Subnet" class="headerlink" title="Example: Subnet"></a>Example: Subnet</h4><p>To learn more about the role of subnets within a VPC, review the following example from the coffee shop.</p>
<p>First, customers give their orders to the cashier. The cashier then passes the orders to the barista. This process allows the line to keep running smoothly as more customers come in. </p>
<p>Suppose that some customers try to skip the cashier line and give their orders directly to the barista. This disrupts the flow of traffic and results in customers accessing a part of the coffee shop that is restricted to them.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419212020219.png" alt="VPC without subnet"></p>
<p>To fix this, the owners of the coffee shop divide the counter area by placing the cashier and the barista in separate workstations. The cashier’s workstation is public facing and designed to receive customers. The barista’s area is private. The barista can still receive orders from the cashier but not directly from customers.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419212102580.png" alt="VPC with subnet"></p>
<p>This is similar to how you can use AWS networking services to isolate resources and determine exactly how network traffic flows.</p>
<p>In the coffee shop, you can think of the counter area as a VPC. The counter area divides into two separate areas for the cashier’s workstation and the barista’s workstation. In a VPC, <strong>subnets</strong> are separate areas that are used to group together resources.</p>
<h3 id="Network-traffic-in-a-VPC"><a href="#Network-traffic-in-a-VPC" class="headerlink" title="Network traffic in a VPC"></a>Network traffic in a VPC</h3><p>When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet. A <strong>packet</strong> is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network. </p>
<p>It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway. Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. These permissions indicate who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.</p>
<p>The VPC component that checks packet permissions for subnets is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html">**network access control list (ACL)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Network-Access-Control-List-ACL"><a href="#Network-Access-Control-List-ACL" class="headerlink" title="Network Access Control List (ACL)"></a>Network Access Control List (ACL)</h3><p>A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.</p>
<p>For example, step outside of the coffee shop and imagine that you are in an airport. In the airport, travelers are trying to enter into a different country. You can think of the travelers as packets and the passport control officer as a network ACL. The passport control officer checks travelers’ credentials when they are both entering and exiting out of the country. If a traveler is on an approved list, they are able to get through. However, if they are not on the approved list or are explicitly on a list of banned travelers, they cannot come in.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419213350516.png" alt="Network ACL"></p>
<p>Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account’s default network ACL or create custom network ACLs. </p>
<p>By default, your account’s default network ACL <strong>allows all inbound and outbound traffic</strong>, but you can modify it by adding your own rules. For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow. Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied. </p>
<h4 id="Network-ACL-Stateless-packet-filtering"><a href="#Network-ACL-Stateless-packet-filtering" class="headerlink" title="Network ACL: Stateless packet filtering"></a>Network ACL: Stateless packet filtering</h4><p>Network ACLs perform <strong>stateless</strong> packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. </p>
<p>Recall the previous example of a traveler who wants to enter into a different country. This is similar to sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance and to the internet.</p>
<p>When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419213455770.png" alt="Network ACL checking"></p>
<p>After a packet has entered a subnet, it must have its permissions evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as Amazon EC2 instances. </p>
<p>The VPC component that checks packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html">**security group</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Security-groups"><a href="#Security-groups" class="headerlink" title="Security groups"></a>Security groups</h3><p>A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic.</strong> You can add custom rules to configure which traffic should be allowed; any other traffic would then be denied</p>
<p>For this example, suppose that you are in an apartment building with a door attendant who greets guests in the lobby. You can think of the guests as packets and the door attendant as a security group. As guests arrive, the door attendant checks a list to ensure they can enter the building. However, the door attendant does not check the list again when guests are exiting the building</p>
<p>If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within the same VPC, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance. </p>
<h4 id="Security-Group-Stateful-packet-filtering"><a href="#Security-Group-Stateful-packet-filtering" class="headerlink" title="Security Group: Stateful packet filtering"></a>Security Group: Stateful packet filtering</h4><p>Security groups perform <strong>stateful</strong> packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.</p>
<p>Consider the same example of sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance to the internet. </p>
<p>When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419213840624.png" alt="Security Group Checking"></p>
<p>With both network ACLs and security groups, you can configure custom rules for the traffic in your VPC. As you continue to learn more about AWS security and networking, make sure to understand the differences between network ACLs and security groups.</p>

Customers enter the web address into their browser, and they are able to access the website. This happens because of <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> resolution. DNS resolution involves a customer DNS resolver communicating with a company DNS server.</p>
<p>You can think of DNS as being the phone book of the internet. DNS resolution is the process of translating a domain name to an IP address. </p>

<p>For example, suppose that you want to visit AnyCompany’s website. </p>
<ol>
<li>When you enter the domain name into your browser, this request is sent to a customer DNS resolver. </li>
<li>The customer DNS resolver asks the company DNS server for the IP address that corresponds to AnyCompany’s website.</li>
<li>The company DNS server responds by providing the IP address for AnyCompany’s website, 192.0.2.0.</li>

<h3 id="Amazon-Route-53"><a href="#Amazon-Route-53" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Route 53"></a>Amazon Route 53</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53"><strong>Amazon Route 53</strong></a> is a DNS web service. It gives developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to internet applications hosted in AWS. </p>
<p>Amazon Route 53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancers). It can route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.</p>
<p>Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can register new domain names directly in Route 53.

<p>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html"><strong>instance store</strong></a> provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240419221014450.png" alt="image-20240419221014450"></p>
<p>Amazon EC2 instances are virtual servers. If you start an instance from a stopped state, the instance might start on another host, where the previously used instance store volume does not exist. Therefore, AWS recommends instance stores for use cases that involve temporary data that you do not need in the long term.</p>

<p>To create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
<p>Because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, it’s important to back up the data. You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.</p>

You have potentially millions of animal pictures that all need to be indexed and possibly viewed by thousands of people at once.</p>
<p>This is the perfect use case for S3. S3 is already web enabled. Every object already has a URL that you can control access rights to who can see or manage the image. It’s regionally distributed, which means that it has 11 nines of durability, so no need to worry about backup strategies. S3 is your backup strategy. Plus the cost savings is substantial overrunning the same storage load on EBS. With the additional advantage of being serverless, no Amazon EC2 instances are needed. Sounds like S3 is the judge’s winner here for this round. </p>
<h4 id="Scenario-2-Amazon-EBS"><a href="#Scenario-2-Amazon-EBS" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: Amazon EBS"></a>Scenario 2: Amazon EBS</h4><p>You have an 80-gigabyte video file that you’re making edit corrections on. To know the best storage class here, we need to understand the difference between object storage and block storage. </p>
<p>Object storage treats any file as a complete, discreet object. Now this is great for documents, and images, and video files that get uploaded and consumed as entire objects, but every time there’s a change to the object, you must re-upload the entire file. There are no delta updates. Block storage breaks those files down to small component parts or blocks. </p>
<p>This means, for that 80-gigabyte file, when you make an edit to one scene in the film and save that change, the engine only updates the blocks where those bits live. If you’re making a bunch of micro edits, using EBS, elastic block storage, is the perfect use case. If you were using S3, every time you saved the changes, the system would have to upload all 80 gigabytes, the whole thing, every time. EBS clearly wins round two. </p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>This means, if you are using complete objects or only occasional changes, S3 is victorious. If you are doing complex read, write, change functions, then, absolutely, EBS is your knockout winner. Your winner depends on your individual workload. Each service is the right service for specific needs. Once you understand what you need, you will know which service is your champion!</p>

<p>An example of a relational database might be the coffee shop’s inventory management system. Each record in the database would include data for a single item, such as product name, size, price, and so on.</p>
<p>Relational databases use <strong>structured query language (SQL)</strong> to store and query data. This approach allows data to be stored in an easily understandable, consistent, and scalable way. For example, the coffee shop owners can write a SQL query to identify all the customers whose most frequently purchased drink is a medium latte.</p>

<p>Amazon RDS is a managed service that automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. With these capabilities, you can spend less time completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications. You can integrate Amazon RDS with other services to fulfill your business and operational needs, such as using AWS Lambda to query your database from a serverless application.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS provides a number of different security options. Many Amazon RDS database engines offer encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored) and encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received).</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-RDS-database-engines"><a href="#Amazon-RDS-database-engines" class="headerlink" title="Amazon RDS database engines"></a>Amazon RDS database engines</h3><p>Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input&#x2F;output (I&#x2F;O). Supported database engines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Aurora</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>MariaDB</li>
<li>Oracle Database</li>

A table is a place where you can store and query data.</p>
<p>Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data. One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs. With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values). You can think of attributes as being different features of your data.</p>
<p>In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time. Additionally, not every item in the table has to have the same attributes. </p>

<h4 id="Scenario-1-Amazon-RDS"><a href="#Scenario-1-Amazon-RDS" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: Amazon RDS"></a>Scenario 1: Amazon RDS</h4><p>Relational databases have been around since the moment businesses started using computers. Being able to build complex analysis of data spread across multiple tables, is the strength of any relational system. In this round, you have a sales supply chain management system that you have to analyze for weak spots. Using RDS is the clear winner here because it’s built for business analytics, because you need complex relational joins. Round one easily goes to RDS. </p>
<h4 id="Scenario-2-Amazon-DynamoDB"><a href="#Scenario-2-Amazon-DynamoDB" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: Amazon DynamoDB"></a>Scenario 2: Amazon DynamoDB</h4><p>The use case, pretty much anything else. Now that sounds weird, but despite what your standalone legacy database vendor would have you believe, most of what people use expensive relational databases for, has nothing to do with complex relationships. In fact, a lot of what people put into these databases ends up just being look-up tables. </p>
<p>For this round, imagine you have an employee contact list: names, phone numbers, emails, employee IDs. Well, this is all single table territory. I could use a relational database for this, but the things that make relational databases great, all of that complex functionality, creates overhead and lag and expense if you’re not actually using it. This is where non-relational databases, Dynamo DB, delivers the knockout punch. By eliminating all the overhead, DynamoDB allows you to build powerful, incredibly fast databases where you don’t need complex joint functionality. DynamoDB comes out the undisputed champion. </p>

<h3 id="The-AWS-shared-responsibility-model"><a href="#The-AWS-shared-responsibility-model" class="headerlink" title="The AWS shared responsibility model"></a>The AWS shared responsibility model</h3><p>You have learned about a variety of resources that you can create in the AWS Cloud. These resources include Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon RDS databases. Who is responsible for keeping these resources secure: you (the customer) or AWS?</p>
<p>The answer is both. The reason is that you do not treat your AWS environment as a single object. Rather, you treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other. AWS is responsible for some parts of your environment and you (the customer) are responsible for other parts. This concept is known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/"><strong>shared responsibility model</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The shared responsibility model divides into customer responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security in the cloud”) and AWS responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security of the cloud”).</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420143533020.png" alt="AWS responsibilities"></p>
<p>You can think of this model as being similar to the division of responsibilities between a homeowner and a homebuilder. The builder (AWS) is responsible for constructing your house and ensuring that it is solidly built. As the homeowner (the customer), it is your responsibility to secure everything in the house by ensuring that the doors are closed and locked. </p>
<h3 id="Customer-Security-in-the-cloud"><a href="#Customer-Security-in-the-cloud" class="headerlink" title="Customer: Security in the cloud"></a>Customer: Security in the cloud</h3><p><strong>Customers are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put <em>in</em> the AWS Cloud.</strong></p>
<p>When using AWS services, you, the customer, maintain complete control over your content. You are responsible for managing security requirements for your content, including which content you choose to store on AWS, which AWS services you use, and who has access to that content. You also control how access rights are granted, managed, and revoked.</p>
<p>The security steps that you take will depend on factors such as the services that you use, the complexity of your systems, and your company’s specific operational and security needs. Steps include selecting, configuring, and patching the operating systems that will run on Amazon EC2 instances, configuring security groups, and managing user accounts. </p>
<h3 id="AWS-Security-of-the-cloud"><a href="#AWS-Security-of-the-cloud" class="headerlink" title="AWS: Security of the cloud"></a>AWS: Security of the cloud</h3><p><strong>AWS is responsible for security <em>of</em> the cloud.</strong></p>
<p>AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of infrastructure. This includes areas such as the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and even the physical security of the data centers from which services operate. </p>
<p>AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure includes AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations. </p>
<p>AWS manages the security of the cloud, specifically the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical security of data centers</li>
<li>Hardware and software infrastructure</li>
<li>Network infrastructure</li>
<li>Virtualization infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you cannot visit AWS data centers to see this protection firsthand, AWS provides several reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have verified its compliance with a variety of computer security standards and regulations.</p>
<h2 id="User-Permissions-and-Access"><a href="#User-Permissions-and-Access" class="headerlink" title="User Permissions and Access"></a>User Permissions and Access</h2><h3 id="AWS-Identity-and-Access-Management-IAM"><a href="#AWS-Identity-and-Access-Management-IAM" class="headerlink" title="AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)"></a>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/"><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong></a> enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.  </p>
<p>IAM gives you the flexibility to configure access based on your company’s specific operational and security needs. You do this by using a combination of IAM features, which are explored in detail in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>IAM users, groups, and roles</li>
<li>IAM policies</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also learn best practices for each of these features.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-account-root-user"><a href="#AWS-account-root-user" class="headerlink" title="AWS account root user"></a>AWS account root user</h3><p>When you first create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html"><strong>root user</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The root user is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create your AWS account. You can think of the root user as being similar to the owner of the coffee shop. It has complete access to all the AWS services and resources in the account.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420150102857.png" alt="AWS recommended step"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[! NOTE]</p>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> use the root user for everyday tasks. </p>
<p>Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.</p>
<p>Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user. Examples of these tasks include changing your root user email address and changing your AWS support plan. For more information, see “Tasks that require root user credentials” in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">AWS Account Management Reference Guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="IAM-users"><a href="#IAM-users" class="headerlink" title="IAM users"></a>IAM users</h3><p>An <strong>IAM user</strong> is an identity that you create in AWS. It represents the person or application that interacts with AWS services and resources. It consists of a name and credentials.</p>
<p>By default, when you create a new IAM user in AWS, it has no permissions associated with it. To allow the IAM user to perform specific actions in AWS, such as launching an Amazon EC2 instance or creating an Amazon S3 bucket, you must grant the IAM user the necessary permissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[! NOTE]</p>
<p>We recommend that you create individual IAM users for each person who needs to access AWS.  </p>
<p>Even if you have multiple employees who require the same level of access, you should create individual IAM users for each of them. This provides additional security by allowing each IAM user to have a unique set of security credentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="IAM-policies"><a href="#IAM-policies" class="headerlink" title="IAM policies"></a>IAM policies</h3><p>An <strong>IAM</strong> <strong>policy</strong> is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.  </p>
<p>IAM policies enable you to customize users’ levels of access to resources. For example, you can allow users to access all of the Amazon S3 buckets within your AWS account, or only a specific bucket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]</p>
<p>Follow the security principle of <strong>least privilege</strong> when granting permissions. </p>
<p>By following this principle, you help to prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to perform their tasks. </p>
<p>For example, if an employee needs access to only a specific bucket, specify the bucket in the IAM policy. Do this instead of granting the employee access to all of the buckets in your AWS account.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Example-IAM-policy"><a href="#Example-IAM-policy" class="headerlink" title="Example: IAM policy"></a>Example: IAM policy</h4><p>Here’s an example of how IAM policies work. Suppose that the coffee shop owner has to create an IAM user for a newly hired cashier. The cashier needs access to the receipts kept in an Amazon S3 bucket with the ID: <code>AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</code>.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420150710136.png" alt="IAM policy example"></p>
<p>In this example, the IAM policy is allowing a specific action within Amazon S3: ListObject. The policy also mentions a specific bucket ID: <code>AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</code>. When the owner attaches this policy to the cashier’s IAM user, it will allow the cashier to view all of the objects in the <code>AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</code> bucket. </p>
<p>If the owner wants the cashier to be able to access other services and perform other actions in AWS, the owner must attach additional policies to specify these services and actions.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that the coffee shop has hired a few more cashiers. Instead of assigning permissions to each individual IAM user, the owner places the users into an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html">**IAM group</a>.</p>
<h3 id="IAM-groups"><a href="#IAM-groups" class="headerlink" title="IAM groups"></a>IAM groups</h3><p>An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. When you assign an IAM policy to a group, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how this might work in the coffee shop. Instead of assigning permissions to cashiers one at a time, the owner can create a “Cashiers” IAM group. The owner can then add IAM users to the group and then attach permissions at the group level. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420150852842.png" alt="IAM groups"></p>
<p>Assigning IAM policies at the group level also makes it easier to adjust permissions when an employee transfers to a different job. For example, if a cashier becomes an inventory specialist, the coffee shop owner removes them from the “Cashiers” IAM group and adds them into the “Inventory Specialists” IAM group. This ensures that employees have only the permissions that are required for their current role.</p>
<p>What if a coffee shop employee hasn’t switched jobs permanently, but instead, rotates to different workstations throughout the day? This employee can get the access they need through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html"><strong>IAM roles</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="IAM-roles"><a href="#IAM-roles" class="headerlink" title="IAM roles"></a>IAM roles</h3><p>In the coffee shop, an employee rotates to different workstations throughout the day. Depending on the staffing of the coffee shop, this employee might perform several duties: work at the cash register, update the inventory system, process online orders, and so on. </p>
<p>When the employee needs to switch to a different task, they give up their access to one workstation and gain access to the next workstation. The employee can easily switch between workstations, but at any given point in time, they can have access to only a single workstation. This same concept exists in AWS with IAM roles.</p>
<p>An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain <strong>temporary access to permissions</strong>.  </p>
<p>Before an IAM user, application, or service can assume an IAM role, they must be granted permissions to switch to the role. When someone assumes an IAM role, <strong>they abandon all previous permissions that they had under a previous role</strong> and assume the permissions of the new role. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]</p>
<p>IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily, instead of long-term.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420151359367.png" alt="IAM roles usage"></p>
<p>Later in the day, the employee needs to update the inventory system. They assume the “Inventory” role. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420151445296.png" alt="IAM roles usage"></p>
<p>This grants the employee access to the inventory system and also revokes their access to the cash register system.</p>
<h3 id="Multi-factor-authentication"><a href="#Multi-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Multi-factor authentication"></a>Multi-factor authentication</h3><p>Have you ever signed in to a website that required you to provide multiple pieces of information to verify your identity? You might have needed to provide your password and then a second form of authentication, such as a random code sent to your phone. This is an example of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/"><strong>multi-factor authentication</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In IAM, multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420151603470.png" alt="MFA"></p>
<p>First, a user enters their IAM user ID and password to sign in to an AWS website.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420151635321.png" alt="MFA"></p>
<p>Next, the user is prompted for an authentication response from their AWS MFA device. This device could be a hardware security key, a hardware device, or an MFA application on a device such as a smartphone.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420151655047.png" alt="MFA"></p>
<p>When the user has been successfully authenticated, they are able to access the requested AWS services or resources.</p>
<p>You can enable MFA for the root user and IAM users. As a best practice, enable MFA for the root user and all IAM users in your account. By doing this, you can keep your AWS account safe from unauthorized access.</p>
<h2 id="AWS-Organizations"><a href="#AWS-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="AWS Organizations"></a>AWS Organizations</h2><p>Suppose that your company has multiple AWS accounts. You can use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations"><strong>AWS Organizations</strong></a> to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.</p>
<p>When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a <strong>root</strong>, which is the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. </p>
<p>In AWS Organizations, you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html"><strong>service control policies (SCPs)</strong></a>. SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]</p>
<p>Consolidated billing is another feature of AWS Organizations. You will learn about consolidated billing in a later module.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Organizational-units"><a href="#Organizational-units" class="headerlink" title="Organizational units"></a>Organizational units</h3><p>In AWS Organizations, you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements. When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions specified in the policy.  </p>
<p>By organizing separate accounts into OUs, you can more easily isolate workloads or applications that have specific security requirements. For instance, if your company has accounts that can access only the AWS services that meet certain regulatory requirements, you can put these accounts into one OU. Then, you can attach a policy to the OU that blocks access to all other AWS services that do not meet the regulatory requirements.</p>
<h4 id="Example-Organizational-units"><a href="#Example-Organizational-units" class="headerlink" title="Example: Organizational units"></a>Example: Organizational units</h4><p>Imagine that your company has separate AWS accounts for the finance, information technology (IT), human resources (HR), and legal departments. You decide to consolidate these accounts into a single organization so that you can administer them from a central location. When you create the organization, this establishes the root.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420152508105.png" alt="OU example"></p>
<p>In designing your organization, you consider the business, security, and regulatory needs of each department. You use this information to decide which departments group together in OUs.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420152548765.png" alt="OU example"></p>
<p>The finance and IT departments have requirements that do not overlap with those of any other department. You bring these accounts into your organization to take advantage of benefits such as consolidated billing, but you do not place them into any OUs.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420152633367.png" alt="OU example"></p>
<p>The HR and legal departments need to access the same AWS services and resources, so you place them into an OU together. Placing them into an OU empowers you to attach policies that apply to both the HR and legal departments’ AWS accounts.</p>
<p>Even though you have placed these accounts into OUs, you can continue to provide access for users, groups, and roles through IAM.</p>
<p>By grouping your accounts into OUs, you can easily give them access to the services and resources that they need. You also prevent them from accessing any services or resources that they do not need.</p>
<h2 id="Compliance"><a href="#Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Compliance"></a>Compliance</h2><h3 id="AWS-Artifact"><a href="#AWS-Artifact" class="headerlink" title="AWS Artifact"></a>AWS Artifact</h3><p>Depending on your company’s industry, you may need to uphold specific standards. An audit or inspection will ensure that the company has met those standards.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/artifact"><strong>AWS Artifact</strong></a> is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS Artifact consists of two main sections: AWS Artifact Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports.</p>
<h4 id="AWS-Artifact-Agreements"><a href="#AWS-Artifact-Agreements" class="headerlink" title="AWS Artifact Agreements"></a>AWS Artifact Agreements</h4><p>Suppose that your company needs to sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services. You can do this through <strong>AWS Artifact Agreements</strong>. </p>
<p>In AWS Artifact Agreements, you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p>
<h4 id="AWS-Artifact-Reports"><a href="#AWS-Artifact-Reports" class="headerlink" title="AWS Artifact Reports"></a>AWS Artifact Reports</h4><p>Next, suppose that a member of your company’s development team is building an application and needs more information about their responsibility for complying with certain regulatory standards. You can advise them to access this information in <strong>AWS Artifact Reports</strong>.</p>
<p>AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations. AWS Artifact Reports remains up to date with the latest reports released. You can provide the AWS audit artifacts to your auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls. </p>
<p>The following are some of the compliance reports and regulations that you can find within AWS Artifact. Each report includes a description of its contents and the reporting period for which the document is valid. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420172632175.png" alt="Compliance reports"></p>
<p>AWS Artifact provides access to AWS security and compliance documents, such as AWS ISO certifications, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and Service Organization Control (SOC) reports.  To learn more about the available compliance reports, visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/">AWS Compliance Programs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Customer-Compliance-Center"><a href="#Customer-Compliance-Center" class="headerlink" title="Customer Compliance Center"></a>Customer Compliance Center</h3><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/customer-center/"><strong>Customer Compliance Center</strong></a> contains resources to help you learn more about AWS compliance. </p>
<p>In the Customer Compliance Center, you can read customer compliance stories to discover how companies in regulated industries have solved various compliance, governance, and audit challenges.</p>
<p>You can also access compliance whitepapers and documentation on topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS answers to key compliance questions</li>
<li>An overview of AWS risk and compliance</li>
<li>An auditing security checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the Customer Compliance Center includes an auditor learning path. This learning path is designed for individuals in auditing, compliance, and legal roles who want to learn more about how their internal operations can demonstrate compliance using the AWS Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="Denial-of-Service-Attacks"><a href="#Denial-of-Service-Attacks" class="headerlink" title="Denial-of-Service Attacks"></a>Denial-of-Service Attacks</h2><p>Customers can call the coffee shop to place their orders. After answering each call, a cashier takes the order and gives it to the barista. </p>
<p>However, suppose that a prankster is calling in multiple times to place orders but is never picking up their drinks. This causes the cashier to be unavailable to take other customers’ calls. The coffee shop can attempt to stop the false requests by blocking the phone number that the prankster is using. </p>
<p>In this scenario, the prankster’s actions are similar to a <strong>denial-of-service attack</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Denial-of-service-attacks"><a href="#Denial-of-service-attacks" class="headerlink" title="Denial-of-service attacks"></a>Denial-of-service attacks</h3><p>A <strong>denial-of-service (DoS) attack</strong> is a deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420174254578.png" alt="DoS attack"></p>
<p>For example, an attacker might flood a website or application with excessive network traffic until the targeted website or application becomes overloaded and is no longer able to respond. If the website or application becomes unavailable, this denies service to users who are trying to make legitimate requests.</p>
<h3 id="Distributed-denial-of-service-attacks"><a href="#Distributed-denial-of-service-attacks" class="headerlink" title="Distributed denial-of-service attacks"></a>Distributed denial-of-service attacks</h3><p>Now, suppose that the prankster has enlisted the help of friends. </p>
<p>The prankster and their friends repeatedly call the coffee shop with requests to place orders, even though they do not intend to pick them up. These requests are coming in from different phone numbers, and it’s impossible for the coffee shop to block them all. Additionally, the influx of calls has made it increasingly difficult for customers to be able to get their calls through. This is similar to a <strong>distributed denial-of-service attack</strong>.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420174347597.png" alt="DDoS attack"></p>
<p>In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, multiple sources are used to start an attack that aims to make a website or application unavailable. This can come from a group of attackers, or even a single attacker. The single attacker can use multiple infected computers (also known as “bots”) to send excessive traffic to a website or application.</p>
<p>To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks on your applications, you can use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield"><strong>AWS Shield</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-Shield"><a href="#AWS-Shield" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield"></a>AWS Shield</h3><p>AWS Shield is a service that protects applications against DDoS attacks. AWS Shield provides two levels of protection: Standard and Advanced.</p>
<h4 id="AWS-Shield-Standard"><a href="#AWS-Shield-Standard" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield Standard"></a>AWS Shield Standard</h4><p><strong>AWS Shield Standard</strong> automatically protects all AWS customers at <strong>no cost</strong>. It protects your AWS resources from the most common, frequently occurring types of DDoS attacks. </p>
<p>As network traffic comes into your applications, AWS Shield Standard uses a variety of analysis techniques to detect malicious traffic in real time and automatically mitigates it. </p>
<h4 id="AWS-Shield-Advanced"><a href="#AWS-Shield-Advanced" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield Advanced"></a>AWS Shield Advanced</h4><p><strong>AWS Shield Advanced</strong> is a paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostics and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks. </p>
<p>It also integrates with other services such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and Elastic Load Balancing. Additionally, you can integrate AWS Shield with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) by writing custom rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks.</p>

You can think of these items as data. The coffee shop owners want to ensure that all of these items are secure, whether they’re sitting in the storage room or being transported between shop locations. </p>
<p>In the same way, you must ensure that your applications’ data is secure while in storage <strong>(encryption at rest)</strong> and while it is transmitted, known as <strong>encryption in transit</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms"><strong>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)</strong></a> enables you to perform encryption operations through the use of <strong>cryptographic keys</strong>. A cryptographic key is a random string of digits used for locking (encrypting) and unlocking (decrypting) data. You can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys. You can also control the use of keys across a wide range of services and in your applications.</p>
<p>With AWS KMS, you can choose the specific levels of access control that you need for your keys. For example, you can specify which IAM users and roles are able to manage keys. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable keys so that they are no longer in use by anyone. Your keys never leave AWS KMS, and you are always in control of them.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-WAF"><a href="#AWS-WAF" class="headerlink" title="AWS WAF"></a>AWS WAF</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf"><strong>AWS WAF</strong></a> is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. </p>
<p>AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer. Recall the network access control lists that you learned about in an earlier module. AWS WAF works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. However, it does this by using a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html"><strong>web access control list (ACL)</strong></a> to protect your AWS resources. </p>
<h4 id="Example-AWS-WAF"><a href="#Example-AWS-WAF" class="headerlink" title="Example: AWS WAF"></a>Example: AWS WAF</h4><p>Here’s an example of how you can use AWS WAF to allow and block specific requests.</p>
<p>Suppose that your application has been receiving malicious network requests from several IP addresses. You want to prevent these requests from continuing to access your application, but you also want to ensure that legitimate users can still access it. You configure the web ACL to allow all requests except those from the IP addresses that you have specified.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420175704065.png" alt="AWS WAF examples"></p>
<p>When a request comes into AWS WAF, it checks against the list of rules that you have configured in the web ACL. If a request does not come from one of the blocked IP addresses, it allows access to the application.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420175807920.png" alt="AWS WAF examples"></p>
<p>However, if a request comes from one of the blocked IP addresses that you have specified in the web ACL, AWS WAF denies access.</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-Inspector"><a href="#Amazon-Inspector" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Inspector"></a>Amazon Inspector</h3><p>Suppose that the developers at the coffee shop are developing and testing a new ordering application. They want to make sure that they are designing the application in accordance with security best practices. However, they have several other applications to develop, so they cannot spend much time conducting manual assessments. To perform automated security assessments, they decide to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/"><strong>Amazon Inspector</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Amazon Inspector helps to improve the security and compliance of applications by running automated security assessments.

<p>After Amazon Inspector has performed an assessment, it provides you with a list of security findings. The list prioritizes by severity level, including a detailed description of each security issue and a recommendation for how to fix it. However, <strong>AWS does not guarantee that following the provided recommendations resolves every potential security issue.</strong> Under the shared responsibility model, customers are responsible for the security of their applications, processes, and tools that run on AWS services.</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-GuardDuty"><a href="#Amazon-GuardDuty" class="headerlink" title="Amazon GuardDuty"></a>Amazon GuardDuty</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty"><strong>Amazon GuardDuty</strong></a> is a service that provides intelligent threat detection for your AWS infrastructure and resources.

<p>CloudWatch uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html"><strong>metrics</strong></a> to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time. </p>
<h3 id="CoudWatch-alarms"><a href="#CoudWatch-alarms" class="headerlink" title="CoudWatch alarms"></a>CoudWatch alarms</h3><p>With CloudWatch, you can create <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html"><strong>alarms</strong></a> that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. </p>
<p>For example, suppose that your company’s developers use Amazon EC2 instances for application development or testing purposes. If the developers occasionally forget to stop the instances, the instances will continue to run and incur charges. </p>
<p>In this scenario, you could create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain threshold for a specified period. When configuring the alarm, you can specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.</p>

You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.</p>
<p>When you have created an estimate, you can save it and generate a link to share it with others.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420192908669.png" alt="AWS Pricing Calculator"></p>
<p>Suppose that your company is interested in using Amazon EC2. However, you are not yet sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient for your use case. In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details, such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input&#x2F;output (I&#x2F;O) requirements. By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-pricing-examples"><a href="#AWS-pricing-examples" class="headerlink" title="AWS pricing examples"></a>AWS pricing examples</h3><p>This section presents a few examples of pricing in AWS services. </p>
<h4 id="AWS-Lambda-1"><a href="#AWS-Lambda-1" class="headerlink" title="AWS Lambda"></a>AWS Lambda</h4><p>To learn more about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">AWS Lambda pricing</a>.</p>
<h5 id="AWS-Lambda-pricing"><a href="#AWS-Lambda-pricing" class="headerlink" title="AWS Lambda pricing"></a>AWS Lambda pricing</h5><p>For AWS Lambda, you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>You can save on AWS Lambda costs by signing up for a Compute Savings Plan. A Compute Savings Plan offers lower compute costs in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage over a 1-year or 3-year term. This is an example of <strong>paying less when you reserve</strong>. </p>
<h5 id="Pricing-Example"><a href="#Pricing-Example" class="headerlink" title="Pricing Example"></a>Pricing Example</h5><p>If you have used AWS Lambda in multiple AWS Regions, you can view the itemized charges by Region on your bill. </p>
<p>In this example, all the AWS Lambda usage occurred in the Northern Virginia Region. The bill lists separate charges for the number of requests for functions and their duration. </p>
<p>Both the number of requests and the total duration of requests in this example are under the thresholds in the AWS Free Tier, so the account owner would not have to pay for any AWS Lambda usage in this month.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420193333891.png" alt="AWS Lambda price"></p>

<h5 id="Amazon-EC2-Pricing-1"><a href="#Amazon-EC2-Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="Amazon EC2 Pricing"></a>Amazon EC2 Pricing</h5><p>With Amazon EC2, you pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running.</p>
<p>For some workloads, you can significantly reduce Amazon EC2 costs by using Spot Instances. For example, suppose that you are running a batch processing job that is able to withstand interruptions. Using a Spot Instance would provide you with up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.</p>
<p>You can find additional cost savings for Amazon EC2 by considering Savings Plans and Reserved Instances.</p>
<h5 id="Pricing-Example-1"><a href="#Pricing-Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Pricing Example"></a>Pricing Example</h5><p>The service charges in this example include details for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Amazon EC2 instance type that has been used</li>
<li>The amount of Amazon EBS storage space that has been provisioned</li>
<li>The length of time that Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) has been used</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, all the usage amounts are under the thresholds in the AWS Free Tier, so the account owner would not have to pay for any Amazon EC2 usage in this month.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420193546289.png" alt="Amazon EC2 price"></p>

<h5 id="Amazon-S3-Pricing"><a href="#Amazon-S3-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="Amazon S3 Pricing"></a>Amazon S3 Pricing</h5><p>For Amazon S3 pricing, consider the following cost components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage -</strong> You pay for only the storage that you use. You are charged the rate to store objects in your Amazon S3 buckets based on your objects’ sizes, storage classes, and how long you have stored each object during the month.</li>
<li><strong>Requests and data retrievals -</strong> You pay for requests made to your Amazon S3 objects and buckets. For example, suppose that you are storing photo files in Amazon S3 buckets and hosting them on a website. Every time a visitor requests the website that includes these photo files, this counts towards requests you must pay for.</li>
<li><strong>Data transfer -</strong> There is no cost to transfer data between different Amazon S3 buckets or from Amazon S3 to other services within the same AWS Region. However, you pay for data that you transfer into and out of Amazon S3, with a few exceptions. There is no cost for data transferred into Amazon S3 from the internet or out to Amazon CloudFront. There is also no cost for data transferred out to an Amazon EC2 instance in the same AWS Region as the Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Management and replication -</strong> You pay for the storage management features that you have enabled on your account’s Amazon S3 buckets. These features include Amazon S3 inventory, analytics, and object tagging.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Pricing-Example-2"><a href="#Pricing-Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Pricing Example"></a>Pricing Example</h5><p>The AWS account in this example has used Amazon S3 in two Regions: Northern Virginia and Ohio. For each Region, itemized charges are based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of requests to add or copy objects into a bucket</li>
<li>The number of requests to retrieve objects from a bucket</li>
<li>The amount of storage space used</li>
</ul>
<p>All the usage for Amazon S3 in this example is under the AWS Free Tier limits, so the account owner would not have to pay for any Amazon S3 usage in this month.</p>

<h2 id="Consolidated-Billing"><a href="#Consolidated-Billing" class="headerlink" title="Consolidated Billing"></a>Consolidated Billing</h2><p>In an earlier module, you learned about AWS Organizations, a service that enables you to manage multiple AWS accounts from a central location. AWS Organizations also provides the option for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html"><strong>consolidated billing</strong></a>. </p>
<p>The consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization. <strong>The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4</strong>, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.</p>
<p>On your monthly bill, you can review itemized charges incurred by each account. This enables you to have greater transparency into your organization’s accounts while still maintaining the convenience of receiving a single monthly bill.</p>
<p>Another benefit of consolidated billing is the ability to <strong>share bulk discount pricing, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in your organization</strong>. For instance, one account might not have enough monthly usage to qualify for discount pricing. However, when multiple accounts are combined, their aggregated usage may result in a benefit that applies across all accounts in the organization.</p>
<h3 id="Example-Consolidated-Billing"><a href="#Example-Consolidated-Billing" class="headerlink" title="Example: Consolidated Billing"></a>Example: Consolidated Billing</h3><p>Suppose that you are the business leader who oversees your company’s AWS billing. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420194751423.png" alt="Consolidated Billing"></p>
<p>Your company has three AWS accounts used for separate departments. In this example, Account 1 owes <code>$19.64</code>, Account 2 owes <code>$19.96</code>, and Account 3 owes <code>$20.06</code>. Instead of paying each location’s monthly bill separately, you decide to create an organization and add the three accounts.</p>
<p>You manage the organization through the primary account.</p>
<p>Continuing the example, each month AWS charges your primary payer account for all the linked accounts in a consolidated bill. Through the primary account, you can also get a detailed cost report for each linked account. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420194917480.png" alt="Consolidated Billing"></p>
<p>The monthly consolidated bill also includes the account usage costs incurred by the primary account. In this case, the primary account incurred <code>$14.14</code>. This cost is not a premium charge for having a primary account. </p>
<p>The consolidated bill shows the costs associated with any actions of the primary account (such as storing files in Amazon S3 or running Amazon EC2 instances). The total charged to the paying account, including the primary account and accounts one through three, is <code>$73.80</code>. </p>
<p>Consolidated billing also enables you to share volume pricing discounts across accounts.</p>
<p>Some AWS services, such as Amazon S3, provide volume pricing discounts that give you lower prices the more that you use the service. In Amazon S3, after customers have transferred 10 TB of data in a month, they pay a lower per-GB transfer price for the next 40 TB of data transferred. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420195037855.png" alt="Consolidated Billing"></p>
<p>In this example, there are three separate AWS accounts that have transferred different amounts of data in Amazon S3 during the current month: </p>
<ul>
<li>Account 1 has transferred 2 TB of data.</li>
<li>Account 2 has transferred 5 TB of data.</li>
<li>Account 3 has transferred 7 TB of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because no single account has passed the 10 TB threshold, none of them is eligible for the lower per-GB transfer price for the next 40 TB of data transferred.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that these three separate accounts are brought together as linked accounts within a single AWS organization and are using consolidated billing.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420195152428.png" alt="Consolidated Billing"></p>
<p>When the Amazon S3 usage for the three linked accounts is combined (2+5+7), this results in a combined data transfer amount of 14 TB. This exceeds the 10-TB threshold. </p>
<p>With consolidated billing, AWS combines the usage from all accounts to determine which volume pricing tiers to apply, giving you a lower overall price whenever possible. AWS then allocates each linked account a portion of the overall volume discount based on the account’s usage. </p>
<p>In this example, Account 3 would receive a greater portion of the overall volume discount because at 7 TB, it has transferred more data than Account 1 (at 2 TB) and Account 2 (at 5 TB).</p>
<h2 id="AWS-Budgets"><a href="#AWS-Budgets" class="headerlink" title="AWS Budgets"></a>AWS Budgets</h2><p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets"><strong>AWS Budgets</strong></a>, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.</p>
<p>The information in AWS Budgets updates <strong>three times a day</strong>. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.</p>
<p>In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.</p>
<h3 id="Example-AWS-Budgets"><a href="#Example-AWS-Budgets" class="headerlink" title="Example: AWS Budgets"></a>Example: AWS Budgets</h3><p>Suppose that you have set a budget for Amazon EC2. You want to ensure that your company’s usage of Amazon EC2 does not exceed $200 for the month. </p>
<p>In AWS Budgets, you could set a custom budget to notify you when your usage has reached half of this amount ($100). This setting would allow you to receive an alert and decide how you would like to proceed with your continued use of Amazon EC2.</p>

<p>This example of the AWS Cost Explorer dashboard displays monthly costs for Amazon EC2 instances over a 6-month period. The bar for each month separates the costs for different Amazon EC2 instance types, such as t2.micro or m3.large. </p>
<p>By analyzing your AWS costs over time, you can make informed decisions about future costs and how to plan your budgets.</p>
<h2 id="AWS-Support-Plans"><a href="#AWS-Support-Plans" class="headerlink" title="AWS Support Plans"></a>AWS Support Plans</h2><p>AWS offers four different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/"><strong>Support plans</strong></a> to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services. </p>

<h4 id="Rehosting"><a href="#Rehosting" class="headerlink" title="Rehosting"></a>Rehosting</h4><p><strong>Rehosting</strong> also known as “lift-and-shift” involves moving applications without changes. In the scenario of a large legacy migration, in which the company is looking to implement its migration and scale quickly to meet a business case, the majority of applications are rehosted.  </p>
<h4 id="Replatforming"><a href="#Replatforming" class="headerlink" title="Replatforming"></a>Replatforming</h4><p><strong>Replatforming</strong>, also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.</p>
<h4 id="Refactoring-re-architecting"><a href="#Refactoring-re-architecting" class="headerlink" title="Refactoring&#x2F;re-architecting"></a>Refactoring&#x2F;re-architecting</h4><p><strong>Refactoring</strong> (also known as <strong>re-architecting</strong>) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features. Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.</p>
<h4 id="Repurchasing"><a href="#Repurchasing" class="headerlink" title="Repurchasing"></a>Repurchasing</h4><p><strong>Repurchasing</strong> involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model. </p>
<p>For example, a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a customer relationship management (CRM) system to Salesforce.com.</p>
<h4 id="Retaining"><a href="#Retaining" class="headerlink" title="Retaining"></a>Retaining</h4><p><strong>Retaining</strong> consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.</p>
<h4 id="Retiring"><a href="#Retiring" class="headerlink" title="Retiring"></a>Retiring</h4><p><strong>Retiring</strong> is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.</p>

<h2 id="Innovation-with-AWS"><a href="#Innovation-with-AWS" class="headerlink" title="Innovation with AWS"></a>Innovation with AWS</h2><p>When examining how to use AWS services, it is important to focus on the desired outcomes. You are properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li>The current state</li>
<li>The desired state</li>
<li>The problems you are trying to solve</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider some of the paths you might explore in the future as you continue on your cloud journey. </p>
<p>To learn more on ways to innovate with AWS, check each of the following three categories.</p>
<h3 id="Serverless-applications"><a href="#Serverless-applications" class="headerlink" title="Serverless applications"></a>Serverless applications</h3><p>With AWS, <strong>serverless</strong> refers to applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers. You don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability. AWS handles these capabilities for you.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda is an example of a service that you can use to run serverless applications. If you design your architecture to trigger Lambda functions to run your code, you can bypass the need to manage a fleet of servers.</p>
<p>Building your architecture with serverless applications enables your developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.</p>
<h3 id="Artificial-intelligence"><a href="#Artificial-intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Artificial intelligence"></a>Artificial intelligence</h3><p>AWS offers a variety of services powered by <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>. </p>
<p>For example, you can perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert speech to text with Amazon Transcribe.</li>
<li>Discover patterns in text with Amazon Comprehend.</li>
<li>Identify potentially fraudulent online activities with Amazon Fraud Detector.</li>
<li>Build voice and text chatbots with Amazon Lex.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Machine-learning"><a href="#Machine-learning" class="headerlink" title="Machine learning"></a>Machine learning</h3><p>Traditional <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> development is complex, expensive, time consuming, and error prone. AWS offers Amazon SageMaker to remove the difficult work from the process and empower you to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.</p>
<p>You can use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen.</p>
<h1 id="Module-10-The-Cloud-Journey"><a href="#Module-10-The-Cloud-Journey" class="headerlink" title="Module 10: The Cloud Journey"></a>Module 10: The Cloud Journey</h1><h2 id="The-AWS-Well-Architected-Framework"><a href="#The-AWS-Well-Architected-Framework" class="headerlink" title="The AWS Well-Architected Framework"></a>The AWS Well-Architected Framework</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html"><strong>AWS Well-Architected Framework</strong></a> helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="/en/AWS-CloudPractitioner/image/image-20240420231535527.png" alt="AWS WAF"></p>
<p>The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars: </p>
<ul>
<li>Operational excellence</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Performance efficiency</li>
<li>Cost optimization</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Operational-excellence"><a href="#Operational-excellence" class="headerlink" title="Operational excellence"></a>Operational excellence</h3><p><strong>Operational excellence</strong> is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  </p>
<p>Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.</p>
<h3 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h3><p>The <strong>Security</strong> pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. </p>
<p>When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate security best practices when possible.</li>
<li>Apply security at all layers.</li>
<li>Protect data in transit and at rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Reliability"><a href="#Reliability" class="headerlink" title="Reliability"></a>Reliability</h3><p><strong>Reliability</strong> is the ability of a system to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions</li>
<li>Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand</li>
<li>Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.</p>
<h3 id="Performance-efficiency"><a href="#Performance-efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Performance efficiency"></a>Performance efficiency</h3><p><strong>Performance efficiency</strong> is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. </p>
<p>Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.</p>
<h3 id="Cost-optimization"><a href="#Cost-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Cost optimization"></a>Cost optimization</h3><p><strong>Cost optimization</strong> is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. </p>
<p>Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.</p>
<h3 id="Sustainability"><a href="#Sustainability" class="headerlink" title="Sustainability"></a>Sustainability</h3><p>In December 2021, AWS introduced a sustainability pillar as part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.</p>
<p>Sustainability is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.</p>
<p>To facilitate good design for sustainability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand your impact</li>
<li>Establish sustainability goals</li>
<li>Maximize utilization</li>
<li>Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings</li>
<li>Use managed services</li>
<li>Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Benefits-of-the-AWS-Cloud"><a href="#Benefits-of-the-AWS-Cloud" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of the AWS Cloud"></a>Benefits of the AWS Cloud</h2><h3 id="Advantages-of-cloud-computing"><a href="#Advantages-of-cloud-computing" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of cloud computing"></a>Advantages of cloud computing</h3><p>Operating in the AWS Cloud offers many benefits over computing in on-premises or hybrid environments. </p>
<p>In this section, you will learn about six advantages of cloud computing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade upfront expense for variable expense.</li>
<li>Benefit from massive economies of scale.</li>
<li>Stop guessing capacity.</li>
<li>Increase speed and agility.</li>
<li>Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.</li>
<li>Go global in minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Trade-upfront-expense-for-variable-expense-1"><a href="#Trade-upfront-expense-for-variable-expense-1" class="headerlink" title="Trade upfront expense for variable expense"></a>Trade upfront expense for variable expense</h3><p>Upfront expenses include data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using computing resources. </p>
<p>Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.</p>
<h3 id="Benefit-from-massive-economies-of-scale-1"><a href="#Benefit-from-massive-economies-of-scale-1" class="headerlink" title="Benefit from massive economies of scale"></a>Benefit from massive economies of scale</h3><p>By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. </p>
<p>Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregates in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale. Economies of scale translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-guessing-capacity-1"><a href="#Stop-guessing-capacity-1" class="headerlink" title="Stop guessing capacity"></a>Stop guessing capacity</h3><p>With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application. </p>
<p>For example, you can launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances when needed and pay only for the compute time you use. Instead of paying for resources that are unused or dealing with limited capacity, you can access only the capacity that you need, and scale in or out in response to demand. </p>
<h3 id="Increase-speed-and-agility-1"><a href="#Increase-speed-and-agility-1" class="headerlink" title="Increase speed and agility"></a>Increase speed and agility</h3><p>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.</p>
<p>This flexibility also provides your development teams with more time to experiment and innovate.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-spending-money-running-and-maintaining-data-centers"><a href="#Stop-spending-money-running-and-maintaining-data-centers" class="headerlink" title="Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers"></a>Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers</h3><p>Cloud computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers. </p>
